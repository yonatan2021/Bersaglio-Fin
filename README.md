# Bersaglio-Fin - Personal Financial Data MCP Server

> **Get closer to your own data, on steroids!**

## Attribution
Bersaglio-Fin is a fork of asher-mcp by @shlomiuziel.
This fork extends and maintains the original project with additional improvements.
All core architecture and design originated from asher-mcp.

A secure, local-first financial data aggregator for Israeli banks and credit card companies, built with TypeScript and powered by [israeli-bank-scrapers](https://github.com/eshaham/israeli-bank-scrapers). Bersaglio-Fin helps you aggregate and analyze your financial transactions across multiple sources while keeping your data private and secure.
Information is scraped and stored in a local, encrypted SQLite database.

## Features

- **MCP Server**: Implements the Model Context Protocol for easy integration with MCP Hosts (e.g. Claude)
- **Extensive Integration**: Supports all Israeli banks and credit card companies provided by [israeli-bank-scrapers](https://github.com/eshaham/israeli-bank-scrapers).
- **Local-First**: Your financial data never leaves your machine
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- **CLI**: Easy setup and management via command line
- **TypeScript**: Built with type safety in mind

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shlomiuziel/asher-mcp.git
   cd asher-mcp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Optional**: Install the system wide `asher` cli command:
   ```bash
   npm install -g .
   ```

5. Install tsx (TypeScript Execute) globally (required for Claude desktop integration):
   ```bash
   npm install -g tsx
   ```

## Database Location

The database file is stored in the following location, depending on your OS:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Asher/database.db`
- **Linux:** `~/.local/share/Asher/database.db`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%/Asher/database.db`

## First Run & Configuration

1. Prepare a `credentials.json` file with your provider credentials.
   See supported providers and credential fields [here](https://github.com/eshaham/israeli-bank-scrapers/blob/master/src/definitions.ts).

2. Ingest your credentials:
   ```bash
   asher ingest-creds -f credentials.json
   ```
   - Use this command to update credentials as needed. Deletion can be done manually (see the `scraper_credentials` table).
   - You will be prompted to enter an encryption key for your database (for first-time setup, you'll re-enter to confirm).

3. During setup, you will be prompted to:
   - Enable notifications (a test notification will help with permissions)
   - Optionally perform the first scrape (recommended to avoid latency and possible timeouts due to the large amount of data)
   - Configure Claude Desktop integration (can be directly launched with `npm run configure:claude`)

## Usage

### MCP Tools

Bersaglio-Fin provides several tools for MCP hosts:

- `fetchTransactions`: Fetch recent transactions and store them in the database.
- `describeTable`: Get detailed information about a table (columns, indexes).
- `listTables`: List all tables in the database.
- `getTableSchema`: Get the schema for a specific table.
- `sqlQuery`: Execute a safe SELECT query on allowed tables (prevents SQL injection and unauthorized access).
- `fetch-last-month-transactions`: Fetch and summarize last month's transactions and expenses.

A sample prompt is included to help you generate a detailed monthly report.

#### Test your MCP server

You can run the MCP Inspector for local testing:

```bash
npm run start:mcp:inspector
```

## Security

- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest.
- Bank credentials are stored securely inside the database using your encryption key.
- The application follows the principle of least privilege (`chmod 600` on the database file).
- The encryption key is requested at runtime and never stored on disk.

## Testing

Run all tests:

```bash
npm test
```
